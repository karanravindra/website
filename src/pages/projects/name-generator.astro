        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
          This is a character-level generative language model trained on a dataset of names. Unlike
          word-level models, this model learns to predict text one character at a time, which makes
          it well-suited for generating short, structured outputs like names.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          The name generator is built using the same principles as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
          models, but at a much smaller scale. Here's how it generates names:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Character Embedding:</strong> Each character is converted into a numerical vector
            that the model can understand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transformer Layers:</strong> The model uses self-attention mechanisms to understand
            patterns in sequences of characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Next Character Prediction:</strong> For each position, the model predicts what
            character is most likely to come next.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sampling:</strong> Instead of always picking the most likely character, the model
            samples from a probability distribution (controlled by temperature).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Generation:</strong> The model continues predicting characters until it generates
            a complete name or reaches the maximum length.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>The model consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Embedding Layer:</strong> Maps characters to dense vectors</li>
          <li><strong>Positional Encoding:</strong> Adds information about character positions</li>
          <li><strong>Transformer Blocks:</strong> Multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward networks</li>
          <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> Predicts probability distribution over all possible characters</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Training Process</h3>
        <p>
          The model was trained on a dataset of thousands of names from various cultures and languages.
          During training, it learned:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Common letter combinations (e.g., "th", "ch", "tion")</li>
          <li>Typical name structures (capital first letter, vowel-consonant patterns)</li>
          <li>Cultural naming patterns and phonetic rules</li>
          <li>When to end a name (learning to predict end-of-sequence tokens)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Concepts Demonstrated</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Autoregressive Generation:</strong> The model generates one character at a time,
            using its previous predictions as context for the next character.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Temperature Sampling:</strong> A hyperparameter that controls randomness. Higher
            temperature = more creative but potentially less coherent outputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-Attention:</strong> The mechanism that allows the model to "pay attention"
            to different parts of the input sequence when making predictions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transfer Learning Principles:</strong> While this model is trained from scratch,
            it demonstrates the same architecture used in large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Character-Level?</h3>
        <p>
          Character-level models have some interesting properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>They can generate novel words that don't exist in the training data</li>
          <li>They handle typos and spelling variations naturally</li>
          <li>They work well with limited vocabulary tasks like name generation</li>
          <li>They require smaller vocabulary sizes (just the alphabet vs. thousands of words)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Experiment Ideas</h3>
        <p>Try adjusting the parameters to see how they affect generation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Low temperature (0.3): More conventional, realistic names</li>
          <li>Medium temperature (0.8-1.0): Balanced creativity and realism</li>
          <li>High temperature (1.5+): Unusual, creative combinations</li>
          <li>Shorter max length: Concise, punchy names</li>
          <li>Longer max length: More elaborate, compound names</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PyTorch:</strong> Model architecture and training</li>
          <li><strong>HuggingFace Transformers:</strong> Implementation framework</li>
          <li><strong>React:</strong> Interactive parameter controls</li>
          <li><strong>TypeScript:</strong> Type-safe frontend code</li>
        </ul>
