        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>
          I make software that helps teams move faster. I focus on practical AI
          tools, data-heavy apps, and the boring glue work that makes systems
          usable. This site is intentionally simple. If you need flashy, I can
          do that too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my time is split between building full-stack products,
          experimenting with NLP/semantic search, and making internal workflows
          less painful.
